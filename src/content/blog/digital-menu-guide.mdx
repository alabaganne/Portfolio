In 2024 I kept hearing the same story from restaurant owners: updating menus was slow, printing costs were painful, and teams wanted better insight into what guests actually ordered. That frustration became the spark for **MenuMate**, a platform that gives restaurants a modern, fully digital menu without losing the warmth of great hospitality.

[MenuMate](https://www.menumate.net) is now the product I point to when people ask what I can build. It is a polished, production-ready experience that shows how I combine design sensitivity with solid engineering practices to solve real problems.

## Why I Built MenuMate

Paper menus cannot keep up with fast-moving restaurants. Prices change weekly, dishes sell out, and guests expect the convenience they get from delivery apps. I wanted to create something that:

- Gives owners complete control over their menu in minutes, not weeks
- Reduces waste and cost by eliminating constant reprints
- Improves the guest experience with richer content, personalization, and accessibility
- Provides actionable analytics so decisions are driven by data instead of guesswork

## Designing a Platform Restaurants Enjoy Using

The product vision centered on helping both sides of the table.

### For Restaurant Owners

- **📱 Digital menu management** with instant publishing—no design tools or printers required
- **🎨 Flexible, mobile-first layouts** that match each restaurant’s brand
- **📊 Real-time dashboard** for tracking orders, sales trends, and guest behavior
- **🌍 Multi-language & currency support** so global teams can operate confidently
- **📄 PDF export** for the handful of places that still need something printable
- **🔗 QR code generation** for every menu state, making it easy to drop on tables or flyers
- **📧 Newsletter system** to nurture repeat visits directly from the dashboard

### For Diners

- **No app to install**—scan, browse, and order instantly
- **Intuitive filtering** for dietary preferences, allergens, and popular pairings
- **Multiple payment options** so checkout feels familiar
- **Table-specific orders** that route straight to the kitchen without confusion

## Architecture at a Glance

MenuMate is built with **Next.js 15** and the App Router, giving me hybrid rendering and fast page transitions. I pair it with **TypeScript** to keep the codebase predictable, and **Tailwind CSS 4** with **shadcn/ui** components to iterate quickly on a clean, consistent UI. Every interaction feels purposeful—from the hero animation powered by **Framer Motion** to the micro-interactions that reassure staff their changes were saved.

On the backend, **Supabase** provides a Postgres database with Row Level Security, so each restaurant operates in its own secure data silo. Supabase Auth handles sign-in flows, and its real-time channels keep dashboards live without needing to refresh.

## Favorite Technical Highlights

- **Instant menu publishing** uses optimistic UI updates plus Supabase subscriptions so staff see changes on every device as soon as they hit save.
- **PDF generation** leverages React PDF to mirror the digital layout for venues that still want a printed option for VIPs or regulatory boards.
- **Analytics and feedback** run through PostHog, letting owners spot their best-selling dishes, drop-off points, and peak ordering hours.
- **QR codes** are generated on demand with QRCode.js, so every table and seasonal campaign has a unique entry point.
- **Delightful alerts** powered by Sonner keep the experience friendly, even when permissions or inventory rules block an update.

## The Stack That Powers MenuMate

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Supabase database, Supabase Auth, Row Level Security policies
- **Extras:** React PDF, QRCode.js, Sonner, PostHog for analytics

If you are curious about the data model, I even documented the schema and RLS approach in a technical companion guide (`docs/DB_OVERVIEW.md`) so teams can understand how everything fits together.

## What’s Next

I’m actively expanding MenuMate with table-side payments, a richer loyalty system, and deeper integrations with POS providers. If you’re evaluating a developer who can ship thoughtful product experiences, MenuMate is proof of how I approach research, design, and delivery end-to-end.
