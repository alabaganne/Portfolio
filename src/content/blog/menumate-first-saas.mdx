In 2024 I decided to stop waiting for the “perfect” idea and ship something real. I kept hearing the same pain from the restaurant owners around me: updating menus was slow, printing costs were painful, and no one had clarity on what guests actually ordered. So I challenged myself to build my first production SaaS from the ground up. The result is **MenuMate**—a modern digital menu and restaurant management platform that blends thoughtful UX with real-time operations.

Today, [MenuMate](https://www.menumate.net) is the flagship project I share with hiring managers and founders. It showcases how I approach product research, system design, frontend craft, and the little moments that make software feel reliable.

## Listening First, Then Building

Before I wrote a single line of code I sat with owners, managers, and servers to map their workflows. Paper menus could not keep up with reality: prices changed weekly, dishes sold out hourly, and guests expected the convenience they get from delivery apps. Those interviews guided the pillars for MenuMate:

- Give owners complete control over their menu in minutes, not weeks
- Remove the recurring printing costs that eat into already thin margins
- Improve the guest experience with richer content, personalization, and accessibility
- Provide analytics so leaders can make decisions based on data instead of gut feelings

## Designing a Product Restaurants Enjoy Using

Building MenuMate meant designing for two audiences at once.

### For Restaurant Owners

I focused on features that make day-to-day operations calmer:

- **📱 Instant menu management** with live previews so changes feel safe
- **🎨 Mobile-first layouts** that adapt to each restaurant’s brand without extra design tools
- **📊 Real-time dashboard** that surfaces sales trends and order volume automatically
- **🌍 Multi-language and currency support** so global teams work in their native context
- **📄 PDF export** for venues that still need a printed option for regulators or VIPs
- **🔗 QR code generation** so each table and marketing campaign has its own entry point
- **📧 Newsletter system** to keep loyal guests engaged directly from the dashboard

### For Diners

I wanted the guest experience to feel effortless:

- **No app required**—scan a QR code and the menu is there instantly
- **Helpful filters** for dietary needs, allergens, and chef recommendations
- **Secure checkout** with familiar payment options
- **Table-specific ordering** that routes straight to the kitchen without mix-ups

## Building My First Production SaaS as a Solo Developer

MenuMate is powered by **Next.js 15** with the App Router so I can mix static content, streaming UI, and API routes in one codebase. **TypeScript** keeps refactors safe, while **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** give me a consistent design language. For motion, I reach for **Framer Motion**—the hero animation and microinteractions reassure staff that their updates were saved.

On the backend, **Supabase** handles authentication, authorization, and a PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security so each restaurant works inside its own secure data silo. Live updates happen through Supabase real-time channels, and jobs like PDF generation and analytics collection sit behind edge functions.

Shipping this solo meant wearing every hat: UX research, system architecture, database design, and QA. I documented the data model and RLS strategy in `docs/DB_OVERVIEW.md` so future collaborators can onboard quickly.

## Technical Highlights I’m Proud Of

- **Instant menu publishing** uses optimistic UI updates plus Supabase subscriptions so teams see changes on every device as soon as they press save.
- **PDF parity** with the digital menu via React PDF, giving owners a polished option for guests who still prefer paper.
- **Actionable analytics** through PostHog, helping owners spot their best sellers, drop-off points, and peak ordering hours.
- **Delightful alerts** powered by Sonner, giving clear feedback when permissions or inventory rules block an update.

## What Comes Next

MenuMate launched as my first production SaaS, but it is far from finished. I am already iterating on table-side payments, loyalty programs, and deeper POS integrations. More importantly, I now have a repeatable framework for turning messy real-world problems into software that feels considered.

If you’re evaluating a developer who can research, design, and ship customer-ready products, MenuMate is my proof. Explore the live experience at [MenuMate](https://www.menumate.net) and let’s talk about building something remarkable together.
