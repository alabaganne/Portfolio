          <p>
            Over the past several years, I have shaped end-to-end product development for startups and scale-ups alikeâ€”from discovery and roadmap definition to architecture, delivery, and iteration. I obsess over clarity, accessibility, and measurable value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of shipping features, I invest in teams: facilitating rituals, documenting shared knowledge, and mentoring engineers to own outcomes. The result is calmer execution, faster learning loops, and products that earn trust.
